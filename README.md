**Ebook Packager** is a sleek, efficient desktop application designed to simplify the process of finding and packaging your favorite books. Built with a powerful Rust backend and a modern React frontend using the Tauri framework, it provides a seamless and secure experience for creating your own ebook collections.

Simply provide a list of books with their titles, authors, and publication years, and the app will automatically search for available EPUB versions, download them, and bundle them into a single, convenient ZIP archive.
